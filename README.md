#Bloc Jams

Bloc Jams is a digital music player like Spotify that Bloc uses to teach frontend web development. We begin by building the backbone of the application layout with HTML, add styling and responsiveness using CSS, and implement interactivity with JavaScript.

##About

This is the very first full project in the Bloc Web Developer program. Since it is the first, many of the instructions are provided with a subsequent explanatin. As the project progresses, more independence is required to help better grasp the concepts. 

The project began with HTML and CSS to provide the basic structure, styles, responsiveness, and to create the pages and views needed. Next, we utilized JavaScript for animation and DOM Scripting for events and functionality.
